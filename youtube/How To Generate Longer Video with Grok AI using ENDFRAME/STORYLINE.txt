STEP 1: THE STORYLINE

Write me a 5 line dialogue between 4 friends.

STEP 2: TEXT TO IMAGE PROMPTS
Now generate a single scene "text to image prompts" for the above story in 3D animation, Pixar-Disney style using this structure in a continuous sentences:
[CHARACTER NAME] [gender], [age], [ethnicity/nationality], [height], [build], [skin tone], [hair length, texture, style, color], [distinct facial features + face shape + key markers, e.g., prominent cheekbones, fine stress lines]. Outfits: [fully described clothing for current stage: top and bottom, head wear, hand wear fabrics/materials role identifiers/accessories footwear]

STEP 3: TEXT TO VIDEO PROMPTS
Script the above story into 8 seconds per script. Ensure every dialogue line must be under 8 words to fit the 8-second temporal limit of the engine without changing any dialogue text in the above story. If the original script has a longer speech, you must split it into multiple shots. If the first character speech is less than 5 words, ensure that the second character speaks immediately in the same shot if the second character's dialogue is within 8 words. At no point, in the scene may a speaking or reacting character look directly into the camera, acknowledge the viewer, or break the fourth wall. All eyelines must remain diegetic and directed toward another character or an in-scene object. Characters react naturally (eye contact with the speaker, subtle gestures). Each shot must strictly follow this structure:

Character DNA:
[CHARACTER NAME] - [gender], [age], [ethnicity/nationality], [height], [build], [skin tone]. [hair length, texture, style, color], [distinct facial features + face shape + key markers, e.g., prominent cheekbones, fine stress lines). Outfits: [fully described clothing for current stage: top and bottom, head wear, hand wear fabrics/materials + role identifiers/accessories + footwear]. Voice tone/accent. 3D pixar render style.

Camera:
Static medium-wide shot, tripod-mounted, horizon locked, zero roll (0°), по axial rotation. No frontal-facing dialogue shots permitted], soft / harsh /fluorescent/cinematic contrast as appropriate.

Setting:
 [Primary location time of day], [key environment details + ambient atmosphere]. [important props), visual continuity maintained across the sequence.

[Action & Lip-Sync:
[Specific physical movement-describe brisk, fluid, natural gestures].
[Character Name] says (direct, firm, natural conversational speed):
"[Dialogue)" (Only include if the character speaks).
Prioritize accurate, fast lip-sync to spoken words; natural real-time motion speed, brisk animation, no slow motion or lingering pauses.
(Note: Lip-sync takes priority over body movement keep gestures lively and quick.)

SFX/Foley:


extend the story to 5 shots. Restart with shot 3
